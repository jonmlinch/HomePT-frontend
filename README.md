# HomePT - A web app allowing physical therapists to talk with patients

Physical therapy can be a stressful venture. It can be uncomfortable for patients who are asked to complete exercises they are unfamiliar with and it can be frustrating for physcial therapists trying to motivate patients to push past their road blocks.

In talking with both physical therapists and patients, it became clear that having a tool to quickly communicate exercise techniques and collect patient feedback could be an invaluable tool to help bridge the time between patient visits.

HomePT is a web-based app allowing physical therapists to "prescribe" workout routines to their patients who can then access their prescibed workout along with accompanying videos showing proper technique. After completing a workout, patients then have the ability to share feedback about how they felt with their physical therapist.

## Next Steps

As time permits, I'd like to add functionality that would allow for better data collection and visualisation, more specific feedback about pain, motivational staements, and ability to find necessary equipment.
